Combinatorial Mathematics Notes
===============================
Group, Turnable World
---------------------
- Number of ways to paint a cube with 6 different colors
   on each face = 6*5*P(4,4)/4/6 = 30
   - four faces form a ring, top side can lie any in 6 orientations.
- Different sides use the same color, what is the number of
   coatings that are there?
  

- Number of ways to color corners of a square with 2 colors R and B = 2^4.
  if square is allowed to rotate, how many different ways?
    classify by number of red dots/point  
   0 red dots - 1
   1 red dots - 1 
   2 red doit - 2   R  R   R  B
                    B  B   B  R
   3 red dot  - 1
   4 red dot  - 1
------------------
Number of ways = 6

- Galois, french mathematician killed in duel, introduced the notion of group. 

- Group, a set and an operation , satisying four conditions
  closure, a.b = c
  associativity, (a.b).c = a.(b.c)
  identity, a.e = e.a = a
  invetible = a.b =b.a = e, b = a^-1

  G={0,1,2,...,n-1} group under addition mod n
  Rigid items rotation in 2D euclidean space forms a group.

- Simple Concepts in group
    - finite  group
    - infinite group
    - |G|o - order of group
    - H is subset of Group, subset group
    - commutative or abelian group.
    - unique identity
    - G limited, a E G, a^r = e => a ^ -1 = a ^ (r-1)
    - r known as the order of a, H = {a,a^2, ... , a^(r-1),a^r=e}
      under it's inherited operations is also a group.
Permutation Group
-----------------
 - Relation between coloring problem and group
 - Permutation Group - finite group
   [1,n] - N order gorup
   P1 = (1 2 3 4  P2 =  (1 2 3 4
          3 1 2 4),      4 3 2 1)

   P1P2 = (1 2 3 4   (3 1 2 4    = (1 2 3 4
           3 1 2 4)   2 4 3 1)      2 4 3 1)

   commutative law doesn't hold not abelian
   satisfies group laws

  - Rotation of equilateral  triangle

  - Conjugate class
       - cycle representation
       - n order cycle (a1a2..an)

       - multiplication of disjointed cycles is exchangeble.
       - p^n = (1) (2) .. (n) = e
   - Any cycle can be represented by the product of swaps.


Coloring
--------
 - rotation and reflection
 - unchanged internal structure.
 - Image equivalence class in permutation group.
 -  4 different rotations
    0,90,180,270
 - k stabilizer 
   Zk group
   eg
 - number of k order cycles.
 - |Ek||Zk|=|G|, orbit-stabilizer theorem
